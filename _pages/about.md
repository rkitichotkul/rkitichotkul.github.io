I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Signal Transformation and Information Representation (STIR) group, advised by <a href='https://www.vivekgoyal.org/'>Prof. Vivek K Goyal</a>.

**Research:** I apply techniques from statistical signal processing, machine learning, and (often convex) optimization to computational imaging and other inverse problems.
Currently, I'm working on probabilistic modeling of single-photon lidar and self-supervised learning for solving inverse problems.

**Previously:** I was a Coterm student (B.S. + M.S.) in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, advised by <a href='https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/'>Prof. John Pauly</a> and <a href='https://stanford.edu/~pilanci/'>Prof. Mert Pilanci</a>. At Stanford, I was fortunate to work with <a href='https://www.cs.umd.edu/~metzler/'>Prof. Christopher Metzler</a> (now at University of Maryland) and <a href='https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/'>Prof. Gordon Wetzstein</a> at <a href='https://www.computationalimaging.org/'>Stanford Computational Imaging Lab</a>.
