I am a 3rd year PhD student at the Signal Transformation and Information Representation (STIR) group, advised by <a href='https://www.vivekgoyal.org/'>Prof. Vivek K Goyal</a>.

**Research:** I apply techniques from statistical signal processing, machine learning, and (often convex) optimization to computational imaging and other inverse problems.
Currently, I'm working on probabilistic modeling of single-photon lidar and self-supervised learning for solving inverse problems.

Previously, I was a Coterm student (B.S. + M.S.) at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University. My B.S. advisor is <a href='https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/'>Prof. John Pauly</a>, and my M.S. advisor is <a href='https://stanford.edu/~pilanci/'>Prof. Mert Pilanci</a>. At Stanford, I was fortunate to work with <a href='https://www.cs.umd.edu/~metzler/'>Prof. Christopher Metzler</a> (now at UMD) and <a href='https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/'>Prof. Gordon Wetzstein</a> at <a href='https://www.computationalimaging.org/'>Stanford Computational Imaging Lab</a>.
