Digital cameras capture images using sensors overlaid with a color filter array, most commonly the Bayer pattern. Each pixel records only one color channel --- red, green, or blue --- requiring a process called *demosaicing* to reconstruct a full-color image. As part of a recent project, I developed a C++ engine to simulate the Bayer pattern and perform demosaicing via OpenCVâ€™s <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/de/d25/imgproc_color_conversions.html">`cvtColor`</a> function.

I used <a href="https://www.libraw.org/">LibRaw</a> to read real RAW images, enabling the engine to process actual sensor data. Demosaicing alone, however, is not sufficient to produce accurate color for real RAW images. Additional steps like black level correction, white balancing, and gamma adjustment are likely necessary.

There could be future updates with other parts of the Image Signal Processing pipeline.
